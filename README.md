  <h2 class="main-right_title">New</h2>
  <div class="main-right_subtitle">
    <a href="#">Hydrogen VS Electric Cars</a>
    <p>Will hydrogen-fueled cars ever catch up to EVs?</p>
  </div>
</div>
```

```css
.main-right {
  width: 60rem;
  padding: 2rem;
  background-color: hsl(240, 100%, 5%);
  color: hsl(36, 100%, 99%);
